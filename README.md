# Car_Project


This is the Heating Car Cover Project, designed to offer a streamlined solution for snow removal from vehicles. The cover, is equipped with its heating elements to efficiently melt snow. Positioned beneath the cover's first layer is a Raspberry Pi microcontroller that manages the system. It connects to sensors and heating elements through long-range wires. The sensors gauge snow depth, and based on these readings, the microcontroller adjusts the heating state to melt snow ensuring optimal performance without manual intervention. The Python script in this repository controls this process, reading sensor data, calculating average distances, and toggling the heating elements accordingly. This setup minimizes manual effort, enhances user comfort, and boosts the efficiency of snow removal.
